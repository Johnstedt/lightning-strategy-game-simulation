# Done

* Bitcoin segment done. 
* Started on lightning segment.
* met with Lars-Daniel Öhman.
* Further correspondence with Christian Decker.
* Read further in to market equilibrium.
* Got a functioning price curve going, although calculation took 55hours.
* Added population deaths and births in the simulation.

# Problem

I am on a good path, got good indications from Lars-Daniel Öhman that I'm on the correct path.
He also brought up ESS, which I'm very familiar with. It feels nice that I am not the only 
one who thinks game theory might be applicable to this problem set.

The price curve is definitely the right way to go. I may have an algorithm in mind that reduces the time
significantly however it's still to long to use it in simulations and an approx needs to be made.

# Do

* Go further with simulation
* Find a better approach to Game Theory in graphs
* Optimize the price curve problem
* Finnish Lightning segment
