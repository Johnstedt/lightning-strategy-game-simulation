# Done

* Finnish document for peer review 1.
* Implemented get a rerouting path if path is not liquid.
* Drafted a proposal for improved fee structure, added to appendix and published in RFC.
* Made small alterations to the whole thesis in preparation for per review 1.
* Read through and made comments on Tobias Nebaeus and Tobias Nordins theses.
* Summarized the optimal fee price in a section. 
* Fixed feedback from Father, Izak. 
* Read chapters 2-5 in Networks, Crowds and Markets.
 
# Problem

There might be some points of this that may be deductive straight up with game theory. As I'm not a math major this might
be a problem. The book NCM seems like a great start to learn the basics and maybe some easier policies might be deducible
by me. 

I have no clue how the even start with the base + proportional fee as the optimal price either than just assuming 
a fixed payment size. How to get the liquidity in to the optimized I do not know.

I will focus on the simulation part, opening and closing channels as well as plotting the survival history as it may
be sufficient without a proper liquidity optimization of fee price. Plotting in general needs to happen this week
as degree distribution and traditional topology needs to be written down.

How to formalize the fee price so it actually works in simulation might be a problem, as brutal to calculate optima
in time complexity and all prices change when one change price.

# Do

* Finnish Scale bitcoin segment, finishing the background segments once and for all.
* Plot survival history
* Plot averages of survival histories.
* Plot box plot of survival histories. 
* Plot degree distribution for traditional topology models.
* Read at least chapter 6 & 7 NCM.
* Some basic open, close policies.
* Get a plan on how to even begin solving the liquidity optimization of fee price and strategies to set fee price in
simulation.
