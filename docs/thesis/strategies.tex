\subsection*{Bankruptcy} 


\section{Strategies}

Following is a list of all implemented strategies and their arguments, 

\section*{Fee Strategies}

The Fee Strategy determine which fee($F_B$, $F_P$) to set to each channel.

\subsection*{random\_fee \texttt{interval\_base} \texttt{interval\_proportional}}

Sets the base- and proportional fee randomly given intervals. This is used as a sanity check benchmark for the other strategies.

\section*{Preferential Attachment Strategies}

The Preferential attachment determine the bias a node use in selecting a node to open a channel with.

\subsection*{random\_attachment}

Selects a random node in the network and opens a channel. It must not be confused with the Erdős–Rényi model as it has an innate age bias.

\subsection*{barabasi-albert}

Selects a node in the network with a probability dependent on degree according to the Barabási-Albert model. The probability is given by:

\[ \Pi(i) = \dfrac{k_i}{\sum_{j}^{}k_j}  \]

where $\Pi(i)$ is the probability to select $i$ with degree $k_i$.

\subsection*{hassan\_islam\_haque}

Randomly chooses a node and then selects one of its neighbors randomly according to the Mediation-driven attachment model. The probability is given by:

\[ \Pi(i) = \dfrac{1}{N} \bigg\lbrack \dfrac{1}{k_1} + \dfrac{1}{k_2} + ... + \dfrac{1}{k_{k_1}} \bigg\rbrack = \dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}\dfrac{1}{k_j}}{N} \]

where $\Pi(i)$ is the probability to select $i$ with degree $k_i$.

\subsection*{inverse\_barabasi\_albert}

Selects a node in the network with a probability inversely dependent on degree. The probability is given by:

\[ \Pi(i) =  \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{k_i}}{\sum_{j}^{n} \dfrac{1}{k_j}} \]
 
where $\Pi(i)$ is the probability to select $i$ with degree $k_i$.

\section*{Timing Strategies}
The Timing strategies determine when a node should close a channel.

\subsection*{sanity\_check}

Does not close any channel whatsoever. It is used as a sanity check benchmark for the other strategies.

\subsection*{bankruptcy\_avg\_usage}

Does close a channel if the usage, on average, leads to bankruptcy. A channel is closed if and only if:

\[ \frac{recent\_profit}{channel\_liquidity} < \frac{floor\_bankrupcy}{total\_funding} \]
 
\subsection*{bankruptcy\_avg\_usage\_aggressiveness \texttt{scalar}}

Similar to \textbf{bankruptcy\_avg\_usage} but scaled with an aggressiveness scalar:

\[ \frac{recent\_profit}{channel\_liquidity} < \frac{floor\_bankrupcy}{total\_funding} \texttt{scalar} \]

\[ \texttt{scalar} \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } 0 < \texttt{scalar}  \]

A \texttt{scalar} greater than 1 may be called a \textit{hawkish} strategy and one lesser than 1 may be called \textit{dovish}.

\section*{Funding strategies}

The funding strategy determine how much the node has available to fund channels.

\subsection*{funding \texttt{[satoshis]}}

Funds the node with \texttt{satoshis}. Although relative a node with large quantity may be called a \textit{rich} strategy and
one with small quantity a \textit{poor} strategy. It may seem dissonant to reefer to wealth as a strategy but remember 
that profit is relative to funding and one operator may have many nodes instead of one large if a \textit{poor} strategy
has higher \textit{fitness}. Further beetle size is similarly referred to as a strategy in EGT.


\section*{Re-balance}

The re-balancing strategy determine if it is worth to re-balance a pair of channels by routing a payment to oneself.

\subsection*{sanity\_check}

Does not re-balance channels whatsoever. It is used as a sanity check benchmark for the other strategy.

\subsection*{linear\_displacement \texttt{[depth]} \texttt{[ratio]}}

Does a \textit{breath-first-search} for cycles with \texttt{[depth]}. If the \texttt{[ratio]} given by an Utility(\ref{sec:linear:displacement}) as,

\[ U(c) = \begin{cases} 
\dfrac{2|(B_{1S} - B_{1M})|}{f_c(|B_{1S} - B_{1M}|)}  & if~B_{1S} - B_{1M} < B_{2M} - B_{2S} \\ 
\\
\dfrac{2|(B_{2M} - B_{2S})|}{f_c(|B_{2M} - B_{2S}|)}  & otherwise
\end{cases} \]

where $B_{1S}$, $B_{2S}$ are the states of the out and in channels and $B_{1M}$, $B_{2M}$ their middles and $f$ is the total fee for the cycle $c$. 

\[f_c(L) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i + P_iL \]

with $B_i$ is the base fee, $P_i$ is the proportional fee for node $i$ in path $c$.

\subsection*{edge\_biased\_displacement \texttt{[depth]} \texttt{[ratio]} \texttt{[scalar]}}

Does a \textit{breath-first-search} for cycles with \texttt{[depth]}. If the \texttt{[ratio]} given by a biased to aforementioned Utility function as,

\[ U'(c) = U(c) \bigg(1,5 - \big(1 - \dfrac{B_{1S}}{2B_{1M}}\big) \bigg)^s \bigg(1,5 - \big(\dfrac{B_{2S}}{2B_{2M}}\big)\bigg)^s  \]

where $s$ is a scalar given as argument \texttt{[scalar]}
