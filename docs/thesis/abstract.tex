\centering \textbf{Abstract}

In payment channel networks, such as the Bitcoin native Lightning Network, the routing
nodes receives a fee as compensation for displaced liquidity, time value of money and operational
costs. Currently this fee is mostly manually set procuring sub optimal profits to
the node operator. The network dynamics may be modeled as a graph and each node as an actor
utilizing strategies in fee price setting, preferential attachment, timing, allocation and
funding akin to Game Theodoric models. Further assuming rational actors and strategy propagation is  
proportional to population suggest similar methodology to Evolutionary Game Theory where
a strategy's fitness will emerge as a fraction of population size.

A simulation study was performed where strategies were played against each other to find emergent equilibria under
competitive market pressure. Where such equilibrium may lie have further consequences for the network in form of 
total throughput, routing cost and robustness. 
This study suggest ... strategies and a robust network topology with short 
average paths will emerge from free competition.
