With the eventual growth of the Lightning Network a fee market for channel liquidity will emerge. How routing nodes 


Fee as a competitive equilibrium

The cost of procuring a shortest path between s and d might be unequal for two different routing nodes dependent on already existing paths and set policies

\section{Pricing function}

Betweenness centrality

\[ g(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq d}\frac{\sigma_{sd}(v)}{\sigma_{sd}} \]

\section{Topology}

Network topology

\[ P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma} \]

\[ p_i = \dfrac{k_i}{\sum_{j}^{}k_j}  \]


Lightning network consists of nodes playing game

Non routing nodes, cheap as possible and possible as private as possible(?) 

Barabási–Albert model

Does it become scale free

does any channel opening algorithm perform better than another and essentially force the network into a scale free hub-spoke network instead of a mesh network?
