\section{Evaluation}

Lightning network consists of nodes playing game

Non routing nodes, cheap as possible and possible as private as possible(?) 

Barabási–Albert model

Does it become scale free

does any channel opening algorithm perform better than another and essentially force the network into a scale free hub-spoke network instead of a mesh network?
