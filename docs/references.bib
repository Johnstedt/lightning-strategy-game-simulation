abstract =     {The least squares adjustment (LSA) method is studied
	as an optimisation problem and shown to be
	equivalent to the undamped Gauss-Newton (GN)
	optimisation method. Three problem-independent
	damping modifications of the GN method are
	presented: the line search method of Armijo (GNA);
	the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM); and
	Levenberg-Marquardt with Powell dogleg (LMP).
	Furthermore, an additional problem-specific "veto"
	damping technique, based on the chirality condition,
	is suggested. In a perturbation study on a
	terrestrial bundle adjustment problem, the GNA and
	LMP methods with veto damping can increase the size
	of the pull-in region compared to the undamped
	method; the LM method showed less improvement. The
	results suggest that damped methods can, in many
	cases, provide a solution where undamped methods
	fail and should be available in any LSA software
	package. Matlab code for the algorithms discussed is
	available from the authors.},
