Hi,


First and foremost thank you for your contribution to Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.

I'm currently working on estimating the lightning node fee to accurately reflect the risk, the time-value of money and 
 the channel balance state. I'm Curious if it's possible to use game theory to prove that the fee is set egoistically and
 what effect that would have on overall network throughput. I'm writing my master thesis on it so I have more or less half a year of full time to dedicate
 to this problem. I'm doing it in collaboration with Cinnober(or I guess Nasdaq as they just got bough up) and have attached the 
 specification we worked out as reference.
 
 Anyway I was simply wondering if you or someone you know is/was working or have though about this problem as I sure can't 
 find anything on it. I would be immensely thankful if you know where I could begin looking or redirect this email
 to someone who might know.
 
 Thank you
