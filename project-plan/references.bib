  keywords =     {adjustment, bundle, convergence, initial values,
                  least squares, terrestrial photogrammetry},
  abstract =     {The least squares adjustment (LSA) method is studied
                  as an optimisation problem and shown to be
                  equivalent to the undamped Gauss-Newton (GN)
                  optimisation method. Three problem-independent
                  damping modifications of the GN method are
                  presented: the line search method of Armijo (GNA);
                  the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM); and
                  Levenberg-Marquardt with Powell dogleg (LMP).
                  Furthermore, an additional problem-specific "veto"
                  damping technique, based on the chirality condition,
                  is suggested. In a perturbation study on a
                  terrestrial bundle adjustment problem, the GNA and
                  LMP methods with veto damping can increase the size
                  of the pull-in region compared to the undamped
                  method; the LM method showed less improvement. The
                  results suggest that damped methods can, in many
                  cases, provide a solution where undamped methods
                  fail and should be available in any LSA software
                  package. Matlab code for the algorithms discussed is
                  available from the authors.},
