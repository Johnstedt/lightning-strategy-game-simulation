# Remote bitcoind RPC client through SSH tunnel
#
# found this great resource https://gist.github.com/EnigmaCurry/bdd9fd28d7a73fe52eb4/revisions
#
# If you have a remote bitcoind you'd like to query it's RPC interface
# from, this script will help you maintain the SSH tunnel to do so.
#
# Set REMOTE_HOST to the user@server your remote bitcoind is running on
# Set LOCAL_FORWARD_PORT to the port you want to run the tunnel on
# Set the RPC_PASSWORD to the rpc password bitcoind is set to use.
# Install bitcoind locally, so that you can use it's query interface.
#
# The first run will setup the SSH tunnel, and leave it running. 
# Subsequent runs will be fast.

# Set port for mainnet
